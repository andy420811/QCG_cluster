 usage:
 xtbiff <xtblmoinfo file1> <xtblmoinfo file2> [-opts]
 where options are:
 default   : global search in 6D intermolecular space
 -sp       : single point energy at input structure
 -opt      : local gradient optimization
 -nfinal   : # of final structures to be optimized
 -parent   : # of parents in genetic opt
 -gen      : # of genetic cycles (generations)
 -hess     : include estimated GRRHO from Lindh Hessian
 -atm      : include ATM term in optimization. Default
             is single point mode (only final energies
             are ATM corrected)
 -debug    : more output (files)
 -stack    : skip some search steps for stacked systems
 -gbsa <solvent> (currently switched off due to bugs)
 use of the -gbsa <solvent> -hess options combined should
 provide a realistic estimate of the full (observable)
 free association energy in solution.
 for condensed phase results use GBSA for monomers.
